Texas 4000 Rider Management System
======

#### Background

The Texas 4000 Rider Management System is an attempt to consolidate riders' biking date into one central datbase, and make the mile recording and reporting ability seamless.

#### Purpose

The purpose of this piece of software is to allow the Texas 4000 team to better manage its intellectual resources. Currently, information is extremely de-centralized in Google Docs, MS Word files, Dropbox accounts, and across the space-time continuum. This Python/Django project attempts to centralize all team information.

#### Is this in production? What's its working status?

1/22/14: No yet. It is just beginning its roots, and I expect it to be in limited use starting 1/27/14.

9/17/14: The system is fully functional, and running for proprietary use.
